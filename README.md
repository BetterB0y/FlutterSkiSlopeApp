<h1>SkiSlope - Mobile App</h1>
<p align="justify">
    This application, developed using the Flutter framework, was conceived as a credit project for engineering studies.
    It is designed to streamline the ticketing process at ski resorts. Users can effortlessly retrieve their ticket list
    through an API integration. The application then generates a QR code for each ticket, which can be scanned to grant
    access through the entrance gates to the ski slopes. This system not only enhances user convenience but also
    optimizes the flow of traffic at the resort, making it an essential tool for modern ski station management.
